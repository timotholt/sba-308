Homework SBA-308
======================================================================

Github address: https://github.com/timotholt/sba-308/

Runtime address: https://timotholt.github.io/sba-308/

======================================================================

This SBA project actually has a real user interface in index.html

The app recursively and intelligently parses the structures
CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, and SubmissionData and presents it in
the html page. The console.log is also fed into the html page so
provide a single user experience for the whole app.

Notes:

In the assignment notes, the assignment requirements is to log the data
to the console. I overrode the console.log() function so that all
console.log() ouputs get sent to BOTH the standard console.log() function
AND written to the console window in index.html.

This project includes a bunch of files:

| *Filename* | *Purpose* |
| :--- | :--- |
| index.html | all the DIVs used for dynamically populating the UI |
| script.js | the usual suspect for storing the bulk of the working code | 
| style.css | the usual style sheet suspect |
| validate.js | where we validate the integrity of the data structures  |
| replaceconsole.js | override console.log so we can output as HTML and the debugger window |
| displayhtml.js | where we populate the div's with our actual data and handling the "live" console window |


Thanks!
