THE INDEX.HTML web page is actually useful and produces useful results!!

In the assignment notes, the assignment requirements is to log the data to the
console. I overrode the console.log() function so that all console.log()
ouputs get sent to BOTH the standard console.log() function AND are written
to the index.html.
